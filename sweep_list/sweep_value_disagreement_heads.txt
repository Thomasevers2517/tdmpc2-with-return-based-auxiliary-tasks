# Sweep: Value disagreement exploration bonus with varying ensemble sizes
# Purpose: Test how num_q (V-heads) and planner_num_dynamics_heads interact
#          with the value disagreement exploration term.
# Grid: num_q ∈ {2,4} × dynamics_heads ∈ {2,4} × lambda_value ∈ {0,1,3}
# Total: 2 × 2 × 3 = 12 runs
