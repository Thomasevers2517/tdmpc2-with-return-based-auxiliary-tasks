Model UTD and Buffer Update Ablation
=====================================

Purpose:
Show that increasing model UTD (updates-to-data ratio) helps, especially when
combined with fast replay buffer updates.

Key insight:
- Higher UTD = more gradient updates per environment step = faster learning
- But this only works well if the replay buffer is updated frequently
- Fast buffer updates + high UTD = significant performance boost

Configuration:
- Task: quadruped-walk
- Sweep:
  - utd_ratio: 1, 2, 4, 8
  - buffer_update_ratio / reanalyze settings
- Compare: High UTD alone vs High UTD + fast buffer updates

Expected outcome:
- UTD=1: Baseline performance
- UTD=4 alone: Some improvement
- UTD=4 + fast buffer: Significant improvement
- The combination is key

Metrics to log:
- Episode return
- Sample efficiency (performance vs env steps)
- Training throughput (updates per second)
