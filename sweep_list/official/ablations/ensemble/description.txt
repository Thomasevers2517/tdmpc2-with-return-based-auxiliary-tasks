Ensemble Ablation
=================

Purpose:
Show that simply adding an ensemble of dynamics and reward heads improves performance,
even WITHOUT any optimism or pessimism anywhere.

Key insight:
The ensemble provides:
1. Better predictions through averaging
2. Extra learning signal from multiple heads

Configuration:
- Task: quadruped-walk
- Optimism: OFF everywhere (planner, policy, TD targets)
- Pessimism: OFF everywhere
- Sweep: num_dynamics_heads, num_reward_heads (1 vs 2 vs more)
- Also ablate: Learning rate scaling with ensemble size

Expected outcome:
- Performance improves just from having multiple heads
- Learning rate scaling is important for proper ensemble training
  (without scaling, larger ensembles don't train as well)

Metrics to log:
- Episode return
- Dynamics loss per head
- Reward loss per head
