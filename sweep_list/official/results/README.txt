========================================

Purpose:
Show our core configuration's baseline performance across different benchmark suites.

Subfolders:
- easy_dmc/         Easy DMC tasks (100k steps)
- hard_dmc/         Hard DMC tasks like humanoid, dog (1M steps)
- humanoid_bench/   HumanoidBench tasks (1M steps)

Each benchmark runs our latest/core configuration to establish baseline numbers.
