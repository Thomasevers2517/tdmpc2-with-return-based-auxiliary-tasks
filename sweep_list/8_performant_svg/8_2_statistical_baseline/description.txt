Sweep 8.2: Statistical Baseline
================================

Purpose:
Run the SVG ensemble baseline with 5 seeds on a representative set of tasks to
establish tight confidence intervals. These numbers serve as the reference for
all 8.3 ablation sweeps.

Configuration:
- 5 seeds
- 100k steps
- 6 tasks: dog-run, hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, humanoid-walk,
           cartpole-swingup-sparse, humanoid_h1-walk-v0
- All config.yaml defaults (SVG ensemble baseline)

NOTE: humanoid_h1-walk-v0 requires the 'bmpc' conda env.

Total runs: 30
