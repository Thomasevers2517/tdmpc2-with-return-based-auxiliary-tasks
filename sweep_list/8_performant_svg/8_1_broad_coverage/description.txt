Sweep 8.1: Broad Coverage
=========================

Purpose:
Run the SVG ensemble baseline (current config.yaml defaults) across ALL supported
single-task environments to check generalization. This is a quick 1-seed sanity
check — not for statistical claims, just to see if anything breaks or if certain
task families behave unexpectedly.

Configuration:
- 1 seed
- 100k steps
- 21 easy DMC + 7 hard DMC + 14 HumanoidBench = 42 tasks
- All config.yaml defaults (SVG ensemble baseline)

NOTE: HumanoidBench tasks require the 'bmpc' conda env when submitting to SLURM.
Consider splitting into separate SLURM submissions for DMC (tdmpc2-new env) and
HumanoidBench (bmpc env) tasks.

Total runs: 42
