Sweep 8.3o: Reward Heads Ablation
==================================

Purpose:
Test adding a second reward ensemble head. With num_reward_heads=2, the reward
prediction has its own uncertainty estimate (std across 2 heads). This feeds into
the optimism/pessimism calculations alongside value uncertainty. With 1 head
(baseline), reward uncertainty is zero and all uncertainty comes from the dynamics
and value ensembles.

Adding reward heads increases model capacity slightly and provides an additional
signal about epistemic uncertainty in the reward model.

Ablated parameter: num_reward_heads
  Baseline: 1 (not run)
  Ablate:   2

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
