Sweep 8.3g: Num TD Rollouts Ablation
=====================================

Purpose:
Test the number of parallel imagination rollouts per starting state for TD target
computation. More rollouts reduce variance in value estimates by averaging over
multiple imagined trajectories, but cost more compute. The baseline uses 4 rollouts.
This sweep checks if 1 rollout (original TD-MPC2 default) is sufficient.

Ablated parameter: num_rollouts
  Baseline: 4 (not run)
  Ablate:   1

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
