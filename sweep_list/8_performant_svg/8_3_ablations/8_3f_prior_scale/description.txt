Sweep 8.3f: Prior Scale Ablation
=================================

Purpose:
Test the scale of frozen random prior networks added to ensemble heads.
Priors encourage diversity between ensemble members by adding a fixed random
perturbation to each head's output. The scale controls how large these
perturbations are relative to the learned output (dimension-aware, so
prior_scale=1.0 means ~1.0 perturbation per output dimension).

prior_scale=0 disables priors entirely (heads may collapse to similar predictions).
Larger values force more diversity but may hurt prediction accuracy if too large.

Ablated parameter: prior_scale
  Baseline: 0.1 (not run)
  Ablate:   0, 1, 3, 10

Total runs: 4 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 48
