Sweep 8.3j: Value Update Frequency Ablation
============================================

Purpose:
Test the value function update frequency. With value_update_freq=2 (baseline),
the value function is updated every 2 environment steps (i.e., half as often as
the world model with UTD=4). Setting value_update_freq=1 means the value is
updated every step, matching the world model update rate. The hypothesis is that
slightly delayed value updates may stabilize training by avoiding chasing a
moving target too aggressively.

Ablated parameter: value_update_freq
  Baseline: 2 (not run)
  Ablate:   1

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
