Sweep 8.3m: Entropy Coefficient Ablation
=========================================

Purpose:
Test the scale of entropy regularization in the policy loss. Entropy encourages
the policy to maintain stochasticity, preventing premature convergence to
deterministic (and potentially suboptimal) behavior.

The baseline uses 3e-5, which is a small but non-zero bonus. Higher values (1e-4)
encourage more exploration through policy randomness but may prevent fine-grained
control. Lower values (1e-5) allow the policy to become more deterministic sooner.

Ablated parameter: start_entropy_coeff
  Baseline: 3e-5 (not run)
  Ablate:   1e-4, 1e-5

Total runs: 2 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 24
