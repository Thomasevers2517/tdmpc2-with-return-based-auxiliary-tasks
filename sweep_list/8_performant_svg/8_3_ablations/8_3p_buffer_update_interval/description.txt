Sweep 8.3p: Buffer Update Interval Ablation
============================================

Purpose:
Test how often new transitions are stored in the replay buffer. The baseline
stores every transition (interval=1). With interval=10, only every 10th
environment step is stored; with interval=500, only every 500th step.

Sparser buffer updates mean the buffer grows more slowly and contains more
diverse (temporally spread) data, but loses fine-grained trajectory information.
This trades off data diversity vs data quantity and temporal coverage. For tasks
with dense rewards, frequent updates help; for sparse rewards, sparser updates
may improve the signal-to-noise by keeping only "interesting" transitions.

Ablated parameter: buffer_update_interval
  Baseline: 1 (not run)
  Ablate:   10, 500

Total runs: 2 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 24
