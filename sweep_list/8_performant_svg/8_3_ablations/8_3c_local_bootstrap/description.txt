Sweep 8.3c: Local Bootstrap Ablation
=====================================

Purpose:
Test the effect of local vs global TD bootstrapping. With local bootstrap (true),
each value head bootstraps from its own predictions, preserving per-head variation
and enabling meaningful uncertainty estimates. With global bootstrap (false),
all value heads receive the same target — collapsing diversity.

Previous results (series 4d) showed local bootstrap significantly helps on all tasks.
This sweep re-confirms with the full 6-task suite.

Ablated parameter: local_td_bootstrap
  Baseline: true (not run)
  Ablate:   false

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
