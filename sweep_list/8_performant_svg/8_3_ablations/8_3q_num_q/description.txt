Sweep 8.3q: Number of Value Heads Ablation
===========================================

Purpose:
Test how the number of value ensemble heads (num_q) affects performance.
More value heads provide better uncertainty estimates via std across heads,
which feeds into optimistic/pessimistic scoring and TD targets. However,
more heads also increase compute cost and may introduce estimation noise if
individual heads are under-trained.

The baseline uses num_q=8 (included in the grid for reference). We test
16 (more heads), 5 (moderate), and 2 (minimal ensemble) to map the
sensitivity of performance to value ensemble size.

Ablated parameter: num_q
  Baseline: 8 (included in grid)
  Values:   16, 8, 5, 2

Total runs: 4 configs × 7 tasks × 2 seeds = 56
