Sweep 8.3a: UTD Ratio Ablation
===============================

Purpose:
Test the impact of update-to-data ratio (UTD) — how many gradient updates the
world model and value function receive per environment step. Higher UTD means
more sample-efficient learning but risks overfitting to limited data. The SVG
baseline uses UTD=4 (from BMPC). This sweep checks whether UTD=2 or UTD=1
(the original TD-MPC2 default) suffice.

Ablated parameter: utd_ratio
  Baseline: 4 (not run — covered by 8.2)
  Ablate:   2, 1

Total runs: 2 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 24
