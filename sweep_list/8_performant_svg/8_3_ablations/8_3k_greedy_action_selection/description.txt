Sweep 8.3k: Greedy Action Selection Ablation
=============================================

Purpose:
Test greedy (argmax) vs softmax sampling for action selection from the planner
during training. The baseline uses softmax sampling from elites (stochastic),
which provides additional exploration through sampling randomness. With greedy
selection (argmax), the planner always picks the single best trajectory — more
deterministic, relying entirely on optimistic scoring for exploration rather
than sampling noise.

Ablated parameter: greedy_train_action_selection
  Baseline: false (not run)
  Ablate:   true

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
