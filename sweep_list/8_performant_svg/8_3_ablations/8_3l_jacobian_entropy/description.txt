Sweep 8.3l: Jacobian Entropy Fix Ablation
==========================================

Purpose:
Test whether using the mathematically correct entropy (with Jacobian correction
for tanh squashing) matters vs the legacy "wrong" entropy (without correction).

When bmpc_policy_parameterization=false, actions are squashed via tanh. The correct
entropy requires a Jacobian correction term: log|det(dF/dx)| = sum(log(1 - tanh²(x))).
This penalizes policies that push actions toward boundaries (±1), because tanh
compresses the distribution there.

With jacobian_correction_scale=0.0 (legacy TD-MPC2), the penalty is removed.
The policy may exploit boundary actions without entropy cost, leading to very
low *true* entropy even if the "wrong" entropy metric looks fine.

IMPORTANT: This sweep requires a code change to always LOG the true entropy
(jac_scale=1.0) regardless of what scale is used in the loss. This lets us
observe the true entropy collapse when jac_scale=0.0 is used for training.

Ablated parameter: jacobian_correction_scale
  Baseline: 1.0 (not run)
  Ablate:   0.0

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
