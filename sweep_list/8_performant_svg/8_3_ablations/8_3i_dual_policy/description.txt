Sweep 8.3i: Dual Policy Ablation
=================================

Purpose:
Test enabling a second "optimistic" policy alongside the main (pessimistic) policy.
The dual policy creates an additional policy network that is trained with an
optimistic value objective (seeking uncertain states). During planning, the
optimistic policy seeds exploratory trajectories while the main policy provides
exploitation. This is a form of directed exploration at the policy level.

Ablated parameter: dual_policy_enabled
  Baseline: false (not run)
  Ablate:   true
  Also set: optimistic_policy_value_std_coef = 0.3 (so optimistic policy seeks uncertainty)

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
