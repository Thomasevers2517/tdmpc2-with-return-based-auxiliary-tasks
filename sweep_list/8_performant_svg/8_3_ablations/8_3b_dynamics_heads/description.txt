Sweep 8.3b: Dynamics Heads Ablation
====================================

Purpose:
Test the number of dynamics ensemble heads. More heads provide better uncertainty
quantification (important for optimistic exploration and pessimistic evaluation)
but cost more compute. The baseline uses 4 heads. This sweep checks if 2 or 1
(original TD-MPC2) are sufficient.

Ablated parameter: planner_num_dynamics_heads
  Baseline: 4 (not run)
  Ablate:   2, 1

Total runs: 2 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 24
