Sweep 8.3h: Eval Planner Optimism Ablation
==========================================

Purpose:
Test the planner's value scoring strategy during evaluation. The baseline uses
planner_value_std_coef_eval=-1 (pessimistic: prefer trajectories where the model
is confident, i.e. min over dynamics heads). This sweep tests eval with 0 (neutral:
mean over heads, no uncertainty adjustment).

The hypothesis is that pessimistic evaluation produces more robust, reliable
actions by avoiding uncertain states, while neutral evaluation may be fooled by
over-optimistic predictions in poorly-modeled regions.

Ablated parameter: planner_value_std_coef_eval
  Baseline: -1 (not run)
  Ablate:   0

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
