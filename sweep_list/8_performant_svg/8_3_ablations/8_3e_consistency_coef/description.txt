Sweep 8.3e: Consistency Coefficient Ablation
=============================================

Purpose:
Test increasing the consistency loss coefficient from 10 (baseline) to 20.
The consistency loss enforces that the world model's latent predictions match
the encoder's output one step later — a self-supervised signal that keeps the
world model grounded. A higher coefficient puts more weight on this grounding
signal relative to reward/value losses. This may help stability but could also
constrain the latent space too much.

Ablated parameter: consistency_coef
  Baseline: 10 (not run)
  Ablate:   20

Total runs: 1 config × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 12
