Sweep 8.3n: Tau (EMA Target Update Rate) Ablation
==================================================

Purpose:
Test the EMA (exponential moving average) update rate for target networks.
tau controls how quickly the target network tracks the online network:
- Small tau (0.001): very slow target updates → stable but may lag behind
- Medium tau (0.003, baseline): moderate tracking speed
- Large tau (0.01, original TD-MPC2): fast tracking → less stable targets

Previous results (series 4b) showed tau=0.01 slightly worsens dog-run but
marginally helps quadruped-walk. Here we also test tau=0.001 (slower) to see
if more conservative targets help on the expanded task suite.

Ablated parameter: tau
  Baseline: 0.003 (not run)
  Ablate:   0.01, 0.001

Total runs: 2 configs × 6 tasks × 2 seeds = 24
