Pre-ablation 1: UTD Ratio
=========================
Sweep ID: 2y0g3dgg
Config:  utd_ratio=2 (baseline=4)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- Hopper-hop:      Significant negative effect. Performs notably worse with UTD=2.
- Quadruped-walk:  No significant negative effect.
- Dog-run:         No significant negative effect.

Conclusion:
  UTD ratio needs to be at least 4. Reducing to 2 clearly hurts hopper-hop.
  Keep utd_ratio=4 (no change from baseline).
