Pre-ablation 10: Encoder Consistency Coefficient
==================================================
Sweep ID: 51019801
Config:  encoder_consistency_coef in {0.1, 1.0} (baseline=0)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- Quadruped-walk:  Higher is better. 1.0 > 0.1 > 0 (baseline).
                   Clear benefit from encoder consistency loss.
- Dog-run:         0.1 seems good. 1.0 breaks performance — too strong.
                   (Note: with consistency_coef=10, adding encoder_consistency_coef=1
                    is a large additional constraint on the encoder.)
- Hopper-hop:      0.1 leads to about average performance (comparable to baseline).

Conclusion:
  Setting encoder_consistency_coef=0.1 is a safe, broadly beneficial choice.
  - Helps quadruped-walk and dog-run.
  - Doesn't hurt hopper-hop.
  - 1.0 is too aggressive (breaks dog-run, likely because combined with
    consistency_coef=10 it over-constrains the encoder).

  Worth further investigation to confirm benefit at scale / on more tasks.
