Pre-ablation 4: Consistency Coefficient
========================================
Sweep ID: orzoode7
Config:  consistency_coef=20 (baseline=10)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- Slightly negative consequences from doubling to 20, but nothing notable.
- Performance largely comparable to baseline.

Conclusion:
  Can set consistency_coef=20 to stay in line with the original TD-MPC2 baseline.
  The difference is minor. Keep at 20 for simplicity / alignment with prior work.
