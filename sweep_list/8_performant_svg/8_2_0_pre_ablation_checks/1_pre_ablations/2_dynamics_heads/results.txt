Pre-ablation 2: Dynamics Heads
===============================
Sweep ID: pio4fts4
Config:  planner_num_dynamics_heads=2 (baseline=4)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- No very negative effect from reducing to 2 heads.
- Maybe a slight performance dip, but it also speeds things up.
- Seems reasonable to use 2 dynamics heads instead of 4.

Conclusion:
  Promising — 2 heads may be sufficient. Speeds up training.
  Follow-up needed: run ablation with 1 vs 2 dynamics heads, more seeds,
  to confirm whether 2 is the sweet spot or if 1 also works.
