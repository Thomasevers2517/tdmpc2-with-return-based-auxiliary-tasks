Pre-ablation 5: Number of Rollouts
====================================
Sweep ID: 6ukbnim9
Config:  num_rollouts=1 (baseline=4)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- No significant negative effect from reducing to 1 rollout.
- Almost slightly better with 1 rollout in some cases.
- Saves compute (fewer imagined rollouts per update).

Conclusion:
  Set num_rollouts=1. Performance is maintained and it saves compute.
