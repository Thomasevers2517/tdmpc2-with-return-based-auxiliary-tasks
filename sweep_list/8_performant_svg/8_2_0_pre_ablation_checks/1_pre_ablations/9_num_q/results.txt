Pre-ablation 9: Number of Q Values
====================================
Sweep ID: p9roraps
Config:  num_q in {5, 16} (baseline=8)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- num_q=16:  Hurts performance on most tasks. Does help dog-run somewhat,
             but at the cost of significantly more compute. Not worth it.
- num_q=5:   Seems fine. Comparable performance while being faster.

Conclusion:
  Set num_q=5. Fewer Q heads, less compute, performance maintained.
  16 is overkill and actively hurts most tasks.
  Aligns with the original TD-MPC2 default (which used 5).
