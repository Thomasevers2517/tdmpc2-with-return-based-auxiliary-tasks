Pre-ablation 7: Value Update Frequency
=======================================
Sweep ID: kv0fro3n
Config:  value_update_freq=1 (baseline=2)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- Hopper-hop:      Significantly worsened. Updating value every step hurts.
- Quadruped-walk:  Not overwhelming effect.
- Dog-run:         Not overwhelming effect.

Conclusion:
  Keep value_update_freq=2 (baseline). Reducing to 1 notably hurts hopper-hop.
  The effect isn't dramatic overall but the hopper-hop degradation is clear.
