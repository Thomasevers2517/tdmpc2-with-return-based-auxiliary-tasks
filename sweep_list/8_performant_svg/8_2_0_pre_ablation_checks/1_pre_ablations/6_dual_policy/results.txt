Pre-ablation 6: Dual Policy
============================
Sweep ID: asr7wp6i
Config:  dual_policy_enabled=true, optimistic_policy_value_std_coef=0.3 (baseline=disabled)
Tasks:   hopper-hop, quadruped-walk, dog-run | 2 seeds | 100k steps

Results:
- Hopper-hop:      Significantly boosted performance. Exploration clearly helps here.
- Quadruped-walk:  Also seems to work / slightly positive.
- Dog-run:         Slightly worse results. Makes sense — more exploration can hurt
                   when exploitation is already effective.

Key Insight:
  The dual policy result proves that policy seeding in the planner is actually
  doing something meaningful — it's not a no-op. The seeded actions provide the
  initial search range for CEM/MPPI. Without meaningful seeds, the random
  initialization wouldn't cover the relevant action space.

  The dual policy essentially says "explore unknown regions with an optimistic
  policy." This helps hopper-hop escape local minima but may hurt tasks where
  staying close to the current best policy is better.

Trade-off:
  - Exploration helps: hopper-hop benefits significantly.
  - Exploration hurts: dog-run slightly worse.
  - It's unclear whether the net effect is positive across all tasks.

Open Question:
  Should we use dual policy? Arguments:
  - PRO: Hopper-hop clearly benefits from extra exploration.
  - CON: Dog-run slightly worse; adds complexity.
  - ALTERNATIVE: Seed with the normal policy (less extreme exploration, draws
    actions toward current best, but limits exploration range).

  Using a normal (non-optimistic) policy for seeding would be less aggressive —
  you go "slightly out of bounds" rather than into fully unknown regions.
  But then you lose the exploration benefit that helped hopper-hop.

Conclusion:
  Keep disabled for now (simplicity), but this is a noteworthy finding.
  The dual policy mechanism does provide meaningful exploration.
  Revisit if exploration proves important on harder tasks.

TODO:
  Run a sweep to test turning off Jacobian correction scale, to verify
  expected results there as well.
