Pessimistic Evaluation Ablation
===============================

Purpose:
Show that evaluating pessimistically (avoiding uncertainty) leads to more stable
and consistent evaluation performance.

Key insight:
During evaluation, we don't want to take risks. We want to do what we know works.
Being pessimistic means avoiding uncertain states/actions, leading to:
1. More stable evaluation scores (lower variance across episodes)
2. Generally better average performance (fewer catastrophic failures)

Configuration:
- Task: Something where evaluation stability matters
- Training: Keep optimistic exploration ON
- Evaluation sweep: planner_value_std_coef_eval from positive (optimistic) to negative (pessimistic)

Expected outcome:
- Pessimistic evaluation: Lower variance in eval scores, more consistent behavior
- Optimistic/neutral evaluation: Higher variance, occasional failures from trying risky actions

Metrics to log:
- Episode return (mean and std across eval episodes)
- Value uncertainty during evaluation
