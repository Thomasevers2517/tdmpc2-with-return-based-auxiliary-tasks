Easy DMC Benchmark
==================

Purpose:
Establish baseline performance on easy DeepMind Control tasks.

Configuration:
- Steps: 100,000
- Tasks: Standard easy DMC tasks (e.g., cartpole-swingup, cheetah-run, walker-walk, etc.)
- Config: Core/latest baseline configuration

Expected outcome:
Strong performance on these easier tasks, demonstrating the method works well on standard benchmarks.
